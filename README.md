# delayed_highmass_WDs_Gaia
I compare the ages from H--R diagram and from transverse velocities to infer delays in high-mass white dwarf evolution. We use this information to estimate the fraction of WD-WD merger products among high-mass white dwarfs and the properties of an abnormal cooling delay which produces the Q branch. We use Gaia DR2 data. This work has been published in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12710. For animations illustrating the abnormal white dwarf cooling, please go to my webpage https://pages.jh.edu/~scheng40/.

This repository contains python files for functions and the MCMC code, and jupyter notebooks for making figures and inspecting data. It also contains data tables with information of the white dwarfs we analysed in the paper.
