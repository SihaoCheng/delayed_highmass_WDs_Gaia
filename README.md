# delayed_highmass_WDs_Gaia
I compare the ages from H--R diagram and from transverse velocities to infer delays in high-mass white dwarf evolution. We use this information to estimate the fraction of WD-WD merger products among high-mass white dwarfs and the properties of an abnormal cooling delay which produces the Q branch.
